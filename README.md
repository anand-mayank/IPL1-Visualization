## Project Structure

**`csv_data`**: This directory contains the dataset: `matches.csv` and `deliveries.csv`

**`ipl`**: This directory contains all your JavaScript business logic

**`public`**: This directory is contains the resulting `data.json` and also the HTML and JavaScript code required to visualize the results. The static server serves the `index.html` file present in this directory

**`node_modules`**: This directory is used by node and npm to store third party packages like `csvtojson` and `http-server`.

**`index.js`**: This file contains the code which: 1. Reads the csv data 2. Calls the JavaScript business logic functions. 3. Saves the results in `public/data.json`
